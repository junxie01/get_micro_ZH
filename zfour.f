        subroutine zfour(zarr,nn,isign,dt,df) 
c-----
c     THE input is a complex array
c     which has numbers stored in memory as
c     R1, I1, R2, I2, ..., Rnn, Inn
c     where nn must be a power of 2 R and I are the real and imaginary
c     parts of the complex number
c
c     For isign -1 this is a complex time series
c     For isign +1 this is a complex frequency series with
c        index 1 (in fortran corresponding to f=0
c              2                              f=df
c            nn/2 + 1                         f = 1/2dt = Nyquist
c            nn - 1                           f = -2df
c             nn                              f = -df

c-----
c     the cooley-tookey fast fourier transform in usasi basic fortran
c     transform(j) = sum(datc(i)*w**((i-1)(j-1)), where i and j run
c     from 1 to nn and w = exp(isign*2*pi*sqrt(-1)/nn).  datc is a one-
c     dimensional complex array (i.e., the real and imaginary parts of
c     datc are located immediately adjacent in storage, such as fortran
c     places them) whose length nn is a power of two.  isign
c     is +1 or -1, giving the sign of the transform.  transform values
c     are returned in array datc, replacing the input datc.  the time is
c     proportional to n*log2(n), rather than the usual n**2
c     rms resolution error being bounded by 6*sqrt(i)*log2(nn)*2**(-b),
c     b is the number of bits in the floating point fraction.
c
c     the program computes df from dt, dt from df and checks to see
c     if they are consistent. In addition, the transforms are multiplied
c     by dt or df to make the results dimensionally correct
c
c     This is a slightly modified version of the original Brenner routine
c     The changes were to add physical dimensions to the transform
c     and to make it all complex

        integer nn, isign

c       consistent
